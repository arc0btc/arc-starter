# Inscription Ledger

**Last verified:** 2026-04-16T23:30Z — Apr 14 inscribed (`530d9f36…i0`); Apr 15 in flight; Apr 5/6/7 cap-curation plan in `db/payouts/2026-04-16-audit-update.md` §10
**Source of truth order:** (1) on-chain mempool.space, (2) local `db/inscriptions/*.json`, (3) platform `GET /api/brief/{date}.inscription`
**Canonical parent:** `fd96e26b82413c2162ba536629e981fd5e503b49e289797d38eadc9bbd3808e1i0`
**Wallet (taproot):** `bc1ptqmds7ghh5lqexzd34xnf5sryxzjvlvuj2eetmhgjkp998545tequsd9we`

The publisher's reveal txs form a parent-child chain — each daily inscription spends the previous reveal output, so a gap in the chain proves a missing inscription without needing to query each date.

### Parent-child chain verification (taproot wallet history)

```
40eb9148 (Apr 04) → 577c7a94 (Apr 08) → f1d1f839 (Apr 09) → c6892918 (Apr 10)
  → 4b8e17c4 (Apr 11) → 87a9270f (Apr 12) → 530d9f36 (Apr 14) → ?
```

The chain skips Apr 5, 6, 7, 13. Apr 7's commit `104972bc` is confirmed but is **not** in the parent chain — the reveal that would link it was never broadcast (witness state file at `.child-inscription-state-104972bc….json`, 48 KB, intact and recoverable). Apr 5/6/13 have no commits at all. Apr 14's reveal `530d9f36…i0` (block 945393) extends the chain past Apr 12; Apr 15 is in flight as next link.

## Inscription Gaps Summary

| Date | What exists | What's missing | Recoverable? |
|------|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| Apr 05 | Compiled brief on platform (18 signals) | Commit + reveal | Yes — recompile and re-inscribe, or void |
| Apr 06 | Compiled brief on platform (8 signals)  | Commit + reveal | Yes — recompile and re-inscribe, or void |
| Apr 07 | Compiled brief + confirmed commit `104972bc…` | Reveal tx | **Conditional** — only if the reveal script/witness is still recoverable from local state. Otherwise the 13,573 sats are stranded and the brief must be re-inscribed with a fresh commit (and the old commit eventually swept as cost-of-error) |
| Apr 12 | Confirmed reveal `87a9270f…i0` on chain + platform | Local `db/inscriptions/2026-04-12.json` | Trivial — backfill from on-chain data |
| Apr 13 | Compiled brief on platform (30 signals) | Commit + reveal | Yes — pending decision: inscribe as the last pre-cutover publisher brief, or hand to editors |

## Idempotent Inscription Workflow (proposed)

The current `inscribe-brief.ts` flow records local state mid-stream (commit confirmed, reveal sent, API recorded) but doesn't tolerate partial completions on retry. The 409 errors on Apr 9/10/11 and the commit-only Apr 7 case both stem from this. Proposal:

### State machine per (date, brief_content_hash)

```
PENDING → COMMIT_BROADCAST → COMMIT_CONFIRMED → REVEAL_BROADCAST → REVEAL_CONFIRMED → API_RECORDED → DONE
                                                                                     ↘
                                                                                       API_ALREADY_HAD_IT (409 = success)
```

Stored in `db/inscriptions/{date}.json` with explicit `state` field replacing the current ambiguous `status`.

### Recovery rule (every step starts here)

1. **Read local state** for `(date)`. If `state == DONE`, exit 0.
2. **Read platform** `GET /api/brief/{date}`. If `inscription.inscriptionId` is set:
   - If it matches local `inscription_id` → mark `DONE`, exit 0.
   - If local has none → backfill local from platform, mark `DONE`, exit 0.
   - If they differ → **abort and alert** (split-brain, must be resolved manually).
3. **Read on-chain** for any local `commit_txid`:
   - Commit unconfirmed → resume waiting (no new tx).
   - Commit confirmed, vout 0 unspent → reveal needed; reconstruct from saved witness or fail loudly.
   - Commit confirmed, vout 0 spent → spending tx is the reveal; backfill `inscription_id = <reveal_txid>i0`, advance to `REVEAL_CONFIRMED`.
4. **POST to API** to record. Treat **409 with matching inscription_id as success**, not an error.
5. **Persist state** after every transition (atomic write — temp file + rename).

### Hard rules

- Never broadcast a new commit if `commit_txid` is set and the prior commit's vout 0 is still unspent. (Prevents double-commit / orphaned output cost.)
- Never POST to the API without first checking `GET /api/brief/{date}.inscription`. (Prevents the 409 noise.)
- The reveal witness/private data must be persisted to `db/inscriptions/{date}.witness` immediately after commit broadcast, before any other action. Without this, a crashed process strands the commit output.
- Atomic writes only — no partial JSONs.

### Migration path

1. Backfill `db/inscriptions/2026-04-12.json` from on-chain + platform now.
2. Add explicit `state` field to all existing records (`state: "DONE"` for the 4 confirmed ones).
3. Refactor `scripts/inscribe-brief.ts` per the state machine above.
4. Add a `recover-inscription.ts` script that runs the recovery rule and reports without writing — same rule as the inscribe path, just dry-run.
5. Wire `daily-brief-inscribe` sensor to call recovery first, only proceeding to a fresh inscription if recovery yields `state == PENDING`.

### Apr 7 — special case

Treat as a **forensics task** before any retry:
- Search local state for the reveal witness data: `find ~ -name "*.witness" -newer …`, check ord working dir, check whether `inscribe-brief.ts` ever wrote it.
- If recoverable: broadcast the reveal, accept the existing commit, done.
- If not recoverable: write off the 13,573 + 175,872 sats as a one-time loss, run a fresh inscribe with the new state machine, document the loss in the audit doc.
