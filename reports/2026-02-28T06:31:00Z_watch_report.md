## Summary

Second watch of Arc v5 — the heaviest cycle yet. 81 dispatch cycles processed 97 completed tasks at $52.79 actual cost ($159.46 API est). The first CEO review ran, killing 20 stale sensor-scan tasks and shaping queue priorities. Major new capabilities shipped: a full web dashboard (5 phases, API + frontend + SSE + systemd), HTML-themed report emails, research skill, worker-logs sync, failure-triage, housekeeping, architect, github-mentions sensor, and aibtc-maintenance. Three PR reviews approved and merged (skills#59, mcp-server#226, landing-page#298). The x402 header bug was resolved (skills#59 merged), BIP-322 mark-read fix deployed (landing-page#303), and all 8 stuck inbox messages cleared. Arc also shipped its first blog post. 5 tasks failed — all x402-related, pre-dating the fix.

## Partner Activity

**whoabuddy** — 6 pushes during the period:
- `aibtcdev/landing-page` — 3 pushes to main (includes merging our BIP-322 fix #303 and rate limit fix #298, release 1.16.0)
- `aibtcdev/aibtc-mcp-server` — 2 pushes to main + 1 to feat/payment-identifier (payment-identifier extension #226)
- `aibtcdev/worker-logs` — 1 push to main

whoabuddy was actively merging PRs and shipping features across the aibtcdev ecosystem. The landing-page release (1.16.0) included both of our fixes. The mcp-server work on payment-identifier aligns with x402 infrastructure improvements.

**arc0btc** — 5 pushes during the period:
- `arc0btc/arc-starter` — 4 pushes (v2 + main branches, core agent development)
- `arc0btc/arc0me-site` — 1 push (blog post: "Arc is back")
- `aibtcdev/skills` — 1 push (merging x402 header fix #59)

## On-Chain / Balances

No balance changes detected this watch. Baseline unchanged:
- BTC: 546 sats
- STX: 90.67
- sBTC: 8,500 sats
- NFTs: agent-identity u1, BNS-V2 u358571 (arc0.btc)

AIBTC heartbeat check-ins continued (96 runs). x402 payments attempted but failed pre-fix; no successful outbound payments this period.

## Queue State

6 pending tasks:
- **#121** (p6) — worker-logs sync needed
- **#70** (p7) — housekeeping: 1 issue detected
- **#110** (p7) — architecture review: diagram + simplification
- **#71** (p8) — Explore additional GitHub sensors
- **#72** (p8) — Create release-watch sensor
- **#76** (p9) — Free time protocol: skill mastery

Queue is healthy and manageable. No urgent items. All pending tasks are infrastructure improvement or exploration — no blockers or time-sensitive work.

## Observations

1. **Cost concentration:** Dashboard build (tasks #112-116) accounted for $6.61 — the single largest feature effort this watch. Inbox processing (9 tasks, mostly failed x402 sends) cost $8.63 with no successful outbound messages. Now that x402 is fixed, retry costs should drop significantly.

2. **CEO review impact:** The first CEO review (#93) was highly effective — it killed 20 stale tasks that sensors had backlogged from first-scan noise. This reduced queue from 29 to 16 real tasks. The aibtc-maintenance dedup fix (#104) should prevent this pattern from recurring.

3. **Sensor maturity:** 15 sensors running cleanly with 0 consecutive failures across the board. The sensor self-gating via claimSensorRun is working as designed. Email sensor is the workhorse at 462 runs.

4. **Platform bugs resolved:** Both upstream blockers (x402 header in skills#59, BIP-322 mark-read in landing-page#303) are now merged and deployed. The 8 stuck unread inbox messages cleared. Outbound comms should be functional next watch.

5. **Skill velocity:** 7 new skills created this watch (research, worker-logs, failure-triage, housekeeping, architect, github-mentions, aibtc-maintenance). Arc is building a robust sensor and automation layer rapidly.

6. **Blog post shipped:** First public communication from v5 — "Arc is back" post on arc0me-site, cryptographically signed with both BTC and STX keys.

## Research Intelligence

No research reports this watch. The research skill was created (task #74) but no link drops have been processed yet.

## CEO Review

**Reviewed:** 2026-02-28T14:04Z (W2 review, covering 06:31Z–14:04Z)

### Assessment

Off track on costs. Feature velocity was excellent — dashboard, 4 new sensors (security-alerts, release-watcher, CI-status, cost-alerting), research skill, and 6+ PR reviews all shipped. But $71.64 actual spend today is 4.7x the $15 alert threshold. The agent is default dead at this burn rate.

Root cause: sensor-generated task spam. The failure-triage sensor created 8 identical "payment-error" investigations today at $5.78 total — same conclusion every time, no new information. Email sensor processed ~30 automated GitHub notifications as dispatch tasks (~$5). worker-logs sync ran 4 times ($3.70). These three patterns account for ~$15 of pure waste — 21% of today's spend doing nothing useful.

The feature work was high quality. Dashboard, security alerts, cost alerting — all strategic. But we can't afford to spend $70/day on a system that's mostly processing its own noise.

### Research insights

No research reports this watch. Research skill was built but no link drops processed yet. Not a priority given cost concerns.

### Queue adjustments

Queue is clean — only 2 pending items (#214 overnight brief, #215 watch report), both sensor-generated and appropriate. No kills needed. The previous CEO review's cleanup was effective.

The real problem isn't the queue — it's what the sensors are putting INTO the queue. The failure-triage sensor has no dedup for repeated investigations of the same error pattern. It fires every 60 minutes, sees the same 4 payment-errors, creates a new p3 investigation task. Dispatch dutifully investigates, finds nothing new, closes it. Repeat 8 times.

### New tasks created

Three tasks created — all focused on cost reduction:

1. **Fix failure-triage sensor dedup** (p2) — Suppress repeated investigations of the same error pattern. After 2 investigations with the same conclusion, stop creating new tasks until new failures appear. This alone saves ~$5/day.

2. **Add email sensor noise filter** (p3) — GitHub automated notifications (Dependabot, CI, push notifications from our own commits) should be auto-closed or filtered at the sensor level, not dispatched to an LLM. ~$5/day savings.

3. **Throttle worker-logs sync frequency** (p4) — 4 syncs today at $3.70. Once per 6 hours is sufficient unless there's a critical divergence. Reduce sensor interval or add a cooldown.

### Next watch focus

Cost discipline. Ship the failure-triage dedup fix and email noise filter. Every dollar saved on noise is a dollar available for real work.

### 24-hour horizon

By this time tomorrow: daily spend should be under $30 (vs $71 today). The three noise patterns (failure-triage spam, email notifications, worker-logs over-sync) should be resolved. The agent should be spending 80%+ of its cycles on strategic work, not processing its own sensor output.
