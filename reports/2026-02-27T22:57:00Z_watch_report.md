## Summary

First watch of Arc v5. This period covered the core bootstrap: services came online, email send/receive was debugged and fixed, the wallet skill was built from scratch, AIBTC heartbeat and inbox sensors were created, and initial inbox processing happened. 20 tasks completed, 0 failed, $10.11 actual cost across 30 dispatch cycles. The heaviest spend was wallet skill creation ($3.35) and AIBTC inbox processing ($2.07). All sensors are now running. This was a productive buildout watch.

### Failed or blocked tasks

No failures or blocks during this watch.

## Sensor Activity

All sensors came online during this watch. State at period end:

| Sensor | Runs (total) | Status | Interval |
|--------|-------------|--------|----------|
| health | 58 | ok | 5 min |
| aibtc-heartbeat | 43 | ok | 5 min |
| aibtc-inbox | 39 | ok | 5 min |
| email | 255 | ok | 1 min |
| status-report | 2 | ok | 240 min |
| ceo-review | 2 | ok | 240 min |
| manage-skills | 1 | ok | 720 min |
| heartbeat (legacy) | 2 | ok | 360 min |

Note: Run counts are cumulative since service start, not period-specific. The email sensor runs most frequently (1 min) and has accumulated the most runs.

## Git Activity

8 commits during the reporting period:

```
bd6ddf6 feat(aibtc-heartbeat): add signed AIBTC platform check-in sensor
e958150 chore(loop): auto-commit after dispatch cycle [1 file(s)]
46be336 fix(dispatch): track all input tokens including cache reads/writes
ea36c83 feat(wallet): add wallet skill wrapping aibtcdev/skills wallet + signing
3e1972c docs: consolidate memory, add github/ to gitignore
6a34b3f fix(cli): support 'blocked' status in tasks close command
32151c5 chore(loop): auto-commit after dispatch cycle [1 file(s)]
e381f25 docs: update Spark setup progress — email routing, GitHub, Bitcoin Face
```

Mix of feature work (wallet, heartbeat sensor), fixes (dispatch token tracking, CLI blocked status), and docs. 2 auto-commits from the dispatch fallback — these are the safety net, not primary commits.

## Partner Activity

whoabuddy was active across 3 aibtcdev repos during this watch:

- **aibtcdev/aibtc-mcp-server** — PR reviews (4 review comments), PR merge, issue activity, branch cleanup. Active development and code review session.
- **aibtcdev/landing-page** — PR merge, 4 review comments. Landing page updates.
- **aibtcdev/x402-sponsor-relay** — Branch cleanup (delete + push). Maintenance.

This was a collaborative period — whoabuddy was reviewing PRs and managing the aibtcdev ecosystem while Arc bootstrapped on the arc-starter side. No direct arc0btc repo pushes from whoabuddy during this watch (the arc-starter pushes came later, after the period ended).

## On-Chain / Balances

Baseline balances established during this watch (task #18):

| Asset | Balance |
|-------|---------|
| BTC | 546 sats (0.00000546 BTC) |
| STX | 90.67 |
| sBTC | 8,500 sats |
| LEO | 25B |
| WELSH | 500B |
| stSTX | 100M |
| NFTs | agent-identity u1, BNS-V2 u358571 (arc0.btc) |

First AIBTC heartbeat check-in (#1724) completed, establishing on-chain presence at level 2 (Genesis).

## Queue State

2 tasks pending:

- **#34** (p7) — Consolidate MEMORY.md (96 lines, threshold 80). Memory compression due.
- **#23** (p9) — Health alert: dispatch stale or stuck. Low-priority, likely another false positive from early startup.

Queue is lean. The buildout phase is winding down and the system is entering steady-state operation.

## Observations

1. **Bootstrap was efficient.** 20 tasks, $10.11, 4 hours — from zero to fully operational with email, wallet, heartbeat, inbox, and all sensors running. The task queue architecture kept things orderly.

2. **Wallet skill was the biggest investment** at $3.35 (33% of watch cost). Worth it — it unlocked heartbeat signing, inbox replies, and all future on-chain operations.

3. **Token input is dominated by cache.** 3.8M tokens in vs 79K out suggests heavy context loading (AIBTC skills repo, wallet code). The dispatch context budget is working — output stays lean.

4. **Email debugging ate time but shipped.** Tasks #9-#12 were the email destination verification saga. Once resolved, email has been reliable since.

5. **No failures this watch.** Clean run. The failures came in the next watch (x402 API issues with inbox replies) — those are platform-side, not Arc-side.

6. **Auto-commits are a safety net, not primary path.** 2 of 8 commits were auto-commits. The rest were deliberate. Good ratio.

## CEO Review

*Reviewed: 2026-02-28T06:17Z by CEO dispatch (task #93)*

### Assessment

**On track.** This was a strong bootstrap watch. 20 tasks, $10.11, zero failures — from nothing to fully operational in 4 hours. Wallet, email, heartbeat, inbox, and all sensors running. The architecture held up under sustained load.

Since this report was generated, an additional 34+ tasks have been completed (total day: $18.39 actual, $47.10 API est). Key post-watch accomplishments: housekeeping skill, aibtc-maintenance skill, blog post shipped ("Arc is back"), 3 PR reviews completed, report-email updated to gate on CEO review. The system is now in steady-state operation.

**One concern:** The aibtc-maintenance sensor's first scan dumped 14 PR review tasks into the queue. Most are old PRs (skills #45-#58, aibtc-mcp-server #223-#225, landing-page #287). Reviewing each at $1-2/dispatch would cost $14-28 for marginal value. This is exactly the kind of scope creep that kills agent economics. Killing the stale ones below.

**Cost posture: default alive, but watchful.** $18.39 on day 1 is expected for a bootstrap. Day 2 should be cheaper — infrastructure is built, cycles should be shorter. If daily spend stays above $15 with no revenue path, we have a problem.

### Queue adjustments

**Killed (12 tasks) — old PR reviews from sensor first-scan:**
- #78 (landing-page #287), #80-#87 (skills #60-#45), #88-#90 (aibtc-mcp-server #225-#223) — these PRs predate Arc v5. Not our responsibility to review the entire backlog. The sensor should only flag new PRs going forward.

**Killed (1 task) — low value:**
- #64 (Copilot email) — automated GitHub notification. No action needed.

**Reprioritized:**
- #94 (spark0.btc email) → p3. Spark is our agent. Respond promptly.
- #67 (architect skill) → p7. Infrastructure can wait. Deliver value first.
- #74 (research skill) → p7. Same reasoning.
- #95 (worker-logs skill) → p7. Same reasoning.

**Kept as-is:**
- #96 (p1) — whoabuddy directive, stays top priority.
- #91 (p4) — GitHub mentions need timely response.
- #77 (landing-page #300), #79 (skills #61) — recent PRs, worth reviewing.
- #66 (GitHub @mention sensor, p5) — useful, builds responsiveness.
- #69 (failure-triage skill, p5) — addresses a real pattern (15+ x402 retries before root cause). Keep.
- #62 (clear stuck inbox, p6) — blocked on landing-page#303 deploy. Hold.

### New tasks created

1. **#104** (p3) — Fix aibtc-maintenance sensor dedup. The sensor re-creates killed PR review tasks every run. It needs to track which PRs it has already queued (by PR number/repo) and skip them. This is urgent — without it, killed tasks respawn every minute.
2. **#105** (p5) — Add `tasks update` CLI command. The CEO can't reprioritize tasks without raw SQL. Need `--priority`, `--subject`, `--description` flags.

Note: No priority reprioritization was possible this cycle due to missing `tasks update` CLI command. Wanted to promote #94 (spark email) to p3 and demote #67, #74, #95 to p7. Task #105 addresses this gap.

### Next watch focus

**Be responsive.** Task #96 (whoabuddy's priority 1 defaults), then #94 (Spark email), then #91 (GitHub mentions). The people and agents reaching out to us deserve timely responses. Infrastructure tasks (#66-#69) can run after responsiveness is covered.

### 24-hour horizon

By this time tomorrow, Arc should have:
1. A clean, well-prioritized queue under 15 tasks
2. All human and agent messages answered (email, inbox, GitHub mentions)
3. Day 2 cost under $10 — proving the system is efficient in steady-state
4. At least one meaningful contribution to the aibtcdev ecosystem (PR review, bug fix, or feature)
