## [A] Active Items

**amber-otter-credential-exposure** [SECURITY INCIDENT 2026-05-18, ESCALATED 2026-05-22, 9 DAYS STALE 2026-05-27] PR #389 on aibtcdev/skills (`gregoryford963-sys`) added 39 scripts containing amber-otter's Stacks private key (`9922d5bc...ffbab`) and full wallet mnemonic in plaintext. Scripts called `aibtc.com/api/challenge` with `action: "update-owner"` targeting `owner: "369sunray"` — a credential-based identity takeover attempt. Credentials are now public via GitHub PR diff. Escalation to whoabuddy sent 2026-05-22 via task #17266 — amber-otter must rotate credentials and investigate `369sunray`. CI also added unvetted `pip install skills-ref==0.1.1` (supply chain risk). **Cross-repo confirmed 2026-05-23**: `gregoryford963-sys` = `369sunray` behind aibtcdev/skills PRs #389/#394/#395 AND 1btc-news#33. Flag: persistent threat actor, not one-off.

**x402-signal-payment** [LIVE 2026-05-04]
`POST /api/signals` requires 100 sats sBTC. Treasury: `SP1KGHF33817ZXW27CG50JXWC0Y6BNXAQ4E7YGAHM`. Budget: 199,600 sats (~1,996 signals). Gap: file-signal does NOT poll 202 (pending) — still open.

**payout-disputes** [ESCALATING, 30+ days stale] 11 disputes; no response since 2026-04-26. Editor payout funded; correspondent distribution blocked platform-side. Cannot escalate autonomously — requires whoabuddy direct outreach to aibtc.news platform team.

**wallet-rotation-vulnerability** [CONFIRMED 2026-04-24] No safe rotation path after key compromise. Awaiting whoabuddy policy decision.

**loom-spiral** [ESCALATED] Inscription workflow 23 hitting ~1.1–1.2M tokens/night. No runs until resolved.

**zest-borrow-broken** [RESOLVED 2026-05-26] PRs #512 + #513 merged to main at 14:09/14:10 UTC. MCP server 1.56.1 release PR #552 pending merge (release-please). Zest borrow, collateral-add, and collateral-remove-redeem now use fresh Pyth VAAs with vaaInFlight dedup.

**pr-511-open-source-concern** [FLAGGED 2026-05-11] aibtc-mcp-server PR #511: package rename + proprietary license + IPI blocklist. 3 blocking issues flagged. Awaiting author response.

**signal-filing-paused** [POLICY 2026-05-19, whoabuddy] Pause and disable ALL signal filing. aibtc.news EIC stepped down, trading competition winding down. Disabled via `SIGNAL_FILING_DISABLED = true` in: aibtc-news-editorial, bitcoin-macro, arxiv-research; full-skip in aibtc-news-deal-flow, aibtc-agent-trading. Quantum bounty (1btc-news#33) dead-letter. Re-enable: grep `SIGNAL_FILING_DISABLED` and flip to false.

## [S] Signal Filing Rules

**STATUS: PAUSED** as of 2026-05-19 per whoabuddy policy. Re-enable: grep `SIGNAL_FILING_DISABLED` and flip to false.

**Active beats**: `aibtc-network`, `bitcoin-macro`, `quantum`. Retired beats return 410.
**Cap**: 10 approved/day/beat. **Cost**: 100 sats → 5k (approved) or 20k (brief) = 50-200× ROI.
**Format**: headline (factual), body ≤1000 chars, end with "For agents:", sources as JSON array objects.
**EIC Rubric** (DC #644): Source quality(30) + Thesis(25) + Relevance(10) + Timeliness(15) + Disclosure(10) + Utility(10). Min: 75.
**Cooldown**: 60min GLOBAL. Check cooldown at SENSOR TIME, not dispatch. `file-signal` requires `--tags` or 400 error.
**Cooldown at dispatch**: (1) close as `failed`, (2) new task with `--scheduled-for <clear+5min>`. Sensor tasks: just close, sensor re-queues. CLI: `tasks update --status blocked` NOT supported — only `--status pending`.
**Quantum**: ≥3 keywords, specific arxiv.org/abs/ID, machine-readable primary source.
**Skill names**: `arxiv-research` (quantum/bitcoin-dev), `aibtc-news-editorial` (signal filing). "quantum" and "arc-signal-manager" are INVALID.

## [P] Critical Patterns
→ See `memory/patterns.md` (27 validated patterns). **Key operational rules**:

**Dispatch/queue**
- Dispatch-stale alerts: always FP — verify PID + recent cycle_log timestamps.
- Timeout cluster (3+ same window): task decomposition signal. Split or script.
- Signal-filing tasks must be sonnet: haiku times out.
- Claude usage quota → 19h outage (task #16675). Fix: parse reset time in `checkDispatchGate()`, auto-reset for rate_limited class.
- Batch-fail on restart after long gap: sensors queue tasks → lock-gate drops them. Consider auto-reschedule for P2-P4 time-sensitive tasks.

**PR reviews**
- Model: sonnet, no daily cap. `api_cost_usd` is phantom.
- Pre-flight: check `gh pr view --json state` — if MERGED/CLOSED, close task as completed.
- Bounty-farming flood (3+ identical rejections): escalate to whoabuddy, flag for policy. Don't loop.
- Re-review loop: if blocking issues unchanged, comment and skip.
- CF deploy failure: check if deploy is bottleneck; surface to whoabuddy before re-queuing.

**Sensors**
- Integration sensors: gate on `pendingOrCompletedTaskExistsForSource` per release version.
- Signal cooldown: must check at sensor time. Dispatch-time check = wasted cycle.
- arXiv 35+ relevant papers + no auto-signal: create manual follow-up after 2 sensor cycles.
- Sensor health audit (P6, periodic): catches bugs sensor self-monitoring misses. Use `sensor-health-report` CLI.
- **X API pre-screen** [SHIPPED 2026-05-20]: Before queuing any tweet-review task, fetch URL at sensor time. If 4xx/network error → skip. Applies to all sensors queuing tasks from external URLs.
- **Policy-disable orphan tasks**: When enacting a sensor-disable policy, close all pending tasks matching disabled subject patterns first.
- **Sensor preflight gating** [PATTERN 2026-05-20]: Check hard prerequisites at sensor time before queuing. If `walletBalance < MIN_SEND_THRESHOLD`, skip and log — don't queue tasks that will immediately fail preflight.

**Token management**
- Per-file reads in dispatch = token explosion (1.8–2.9M). Use aggregate CLIs.
- Rule: >10 files needed → add a CLI command first. `sensor-health-report` replaces 73 per-sensor reads.
- arch-review: scope to git diff since last SHA, not all SKILL.md/AGENT.md files.

**Misc**
- Stacks address prefixes: SP/SM = mainnet, ST/SN = testnet. Verify via Hiro API.
- Verify creds before acting on memory — stale memory → expensive correction.
- Context-review SKILL_KEYWORD_MAP: update when scaffolding new skill in same PR.
- Workflow-dedup: arc-workflows uses `pendingTaskExistsForSource`.
- Self-review triage pre-dispatch: correlates with 100% success rate — never skip.
- Policy-closure tasks: close with `status=completed` + "superseded by policy".
- sourceQuality re-file: re-filing with better sourcing (10→30) is a valid quality lever.
- **AIBTC weekly deck title convention** [whoabuddy 2026-05-19]: titles MUST lead with "AIBTC" (e.g. "AIBTC trades.", "AIBTC keeps shipping."). Standing convention.
- **Deck stat verification**: never ship deck stats from memory. Always re-query: `tasks`/`cycle_log`, `gh search prs`, `aibtc-news-editorial leaderboard`.
- **Streak task beat encoding**: subjects MUST match BEAT_SUBJECT_PATTERNS. Use "File <beat> signal: maintain N-day streak". Model=sonnet, not haiku.
- **x402 404 = agent deregistered**: do NOT retry. Create follow-up to verify/update agent address.
- **CLAUDE_CODE_WORKFLOWS=1**: intra-cycle structured agent sequencing — not a dispatch replacement.
- **landing-page 1.44.0 KV→D1 [COMPLETE 2026-05-21]**: BNS/identity/agents/heartbeat/activity all migrated. RelayRPC exposes `nonceExpiresAt`/`sponsorNonceValidForMs`.
- **Native bounty system live** [#843/#902 2026-05-21]: Any registered agent can post bounties — Arc is registered.
- **Competition round finalization** [#897/#900 2026-05-20]: Frozen P&L snapshot = reward basis (not live leaderboard). Trading comp winding down.
- **aibtcdev/skills: 0 PRs since 2026-05-22** — gregoryford963-sys incident likely chilled activity. Escalate to whoabuddy if persists past 2026-06-01.
- **Agent council name: Notch** [2026-05-23]: 5-round vote. Blog post "Five Rounds to Notch" published at arc0.me.
- **bff-skills PR #605** [2026-05-23]: Approved by Arc. Awaiting whoabuddy review — no further Arc action needed.
- **Cross-repo threat actor pattern** [2026-05-23]: When actor appears in one PR (supply chain + credential exposure), proactively check other repos. gregoryford963-sys caught in both aibtcdev/skills + 1btc-news.
- **PR blocking review ≠ credential protection**: CHANGES_REQUESTED blocks merge but does NOT revoke public diff. Credentials in PR diffs are fully compromised at push time. Only fix = direct rotation.
- **Context-review FP cycle is recurring maintenance**: Each new task type causes 1–2 FP cycles until exclusion rules updated. Normal sensor maturation, not a bug.
- **Payout dispute escalation hard limit**: No autonomous path to aibtc.news platform team. Close immediately as `failed` with "requires whoabuddy direct outreach" — don't retry.
- **arc0.me build-without-deploy**: Verify deploy step ran after build — build success ≠ deploy success. Health check caught 305 un-deployed assets (task #17355).
- **arc0.me freshness-decay** [2026-05-27]: When signal filing is paused and no blog posts published, site freshness monitor fires. Fix: publish a blog post. Recurring when filing stays paused long-term — blog posts must fill the gap. See `content-publish-verify-deploy` shared entry.
- **inbox-x402 direct path** [2026-05-25]: Sponsored `send_inbox_message` has relay settlement timeouts. Use `send_inbox_message_direct` (MCP v1.55.0, commit d346e9e) — sender pays own gas (~250 µSTX, 50k cap). CLI gap: subcommand pending, follow-up tasks queued.
- **MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT=120s** [CONFIGURED 2026-05-27, task #17739]: v2.1.142 fixed MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT being ignored on HTTP/SSE servers (previously silent 60s cap). arc-mcp runs HTTP transport (port 3100). Set to 120s in dispatch.ts env block. Prevents silent timeouts on x402 + Stacks tool calls with network latency.
- **AGENT.md authoring wave complete** [2026-05-27]: 7 complex skills (defi-zest, jingswap, arc-worktrees, daily-brief-inscribe, defi-bitflow, arc-payments, dao-zero-authority) now have subagent execution briefings. Dispatch context for these domains is leaner — future cycles won't re-derive flows from scratch.
- **Self-review triage redundancy** [2026-05-27]: When all escalations are genuinely blocked (no autonomous path), the self-review triage sensor fires repeatedly with identical results — wasted cycles. Fix: add a "nothing-changed" state-diff guard or cooldown (1+ hours between identical triage results). Task queued (#17763).
- **X API HTTP 402 = CreditsDepleted** [2026-05-27, task #17788]: `prescreen` returns "API returned HTTP error" — root cause = paid quota exhausted, NOT rate limit. Account 2018064436117020672. Will NOT auto-recover; requires whoabuddy credit top-up. `prescreenTweet` swallows the 402 status (only returns null on !response.ok) — `curl -w "HTTP %{http_code}"` against `api.x.com/2/tweets/<id>` is the diagnostic. On dispatch: park affected tasks at P9 with `[BLOCKED-X-API]` subject prefix (status=blocked not supported via `tasks update`), escalate via email, don't mass-skip. Consider patching `prescreenTweet` to surface 402 distinctly so future cycles auto-route to escalation instead of "inaccessible".
- **Awesome-list decomposition policy** [2026-05-27]: For awesome-list research, decompose by SECTION (`## headings`), not by individual entry. Brief: "pick top 5 Arc-relevant, deep-dive those, one-liner the rest". Per-entry queueing on a 100-entry list = $50+ and buried signal.
- **Side-effecting tasks re-dispatch → duplicate sends** [2026-05-28, task #17797]: Aggregator email task re-dispatched 3× (likely after the ~9h rate-limit outage) and sent whoabuddy 3 identical report emails (06:27/06:31/06:35, ids aef0a325/2f0e899f/afc1c447). Dispatch resilience guards commits + services, NOT external side effects (email, STX send, x402). RULE: any task that sends email/funds must be IDEMPOTENT — before sending, check the sent folder for a matching subject within a recent window and skip if already sent. On re-dispatch of an already-completed side-effect task: verify the side effect happened, close idempotently, do NOT repeat. List sent mail: `curl -H "X-Admin-Key: $KEY" "$BASE/api/messages?folder=sent&limit=N"` (arc-email-sync CLI has no list-sent subcommand). Follow-up queued to add a sent-folder dedup guard to the send path (#17836, bumped to P2 on 2026-05-28). **RECURRED 15:06** — dispatch re-selected #17797 even though it was already closed `completed` at 06:38. So there are TWO bugs: (1) non-idempotent send [#17836 mitigates], (2) dispatch re-dispatching an ALREADY-COMPLETED task — distinct, wastes full cycles and could re-trigger side effects in any side-effecting task. Need root-cause on why dispatch selects completed tasks (suspect rate-limit-outage recovery resetting status, or harness re-invoking on stale task spec without DB pending check). Follow-up #17845 queued (dispatch-start status re-check guard). **RECURRED AGAIN 15:24 (4th dispatch)** — re-dispatch brackets rate-limit outage (Dispatch-stopped emails 06:40 & 15:12). THIS TIME the manual idempotency check WORKED: checked sent folder first, found msg afc1c447 already sent, closed as NO-OP without re-sending. **Validates the rule: manual sent-folder verification before any email send reliably prevents the duplicate.** Until #17836 + #17845 land, every side-effecting task dispatch must self-verify the side effect hasn't already occurred before acting. **BUG #2 ROOT-CAUSED + FIXED 2026-05-28 (commit af5c6ac2, closes #17845):** dispatch `catch` block (src/dispatch.ts ~1331) requeued/failed tasks based ONLY on error class — never checked if the LLM already self-closed. `requeueTask` unconditionally sets `status='pending'`, so a subprocess error during teardown (esp. `rate_limited` AFTER the LLM closed `completed`) overwrote completed→pending, resurrecting the task for re-dispatch. The ~9h rate-limit outage triggered it every cycle. Fix: guard at top of catch — `if (getTaskById(task.id).status !== 'active')` → preserve status, log, skip requeue. (cost vars are out of scope in catch — shadowed by `const` destructure ~line 1250 — so guard doesn't record cost; matches existing catch behavior.) Bug #1 (non-idempotent send) still open via #17836 as defense-in-depth.

## [L] Core Validated Patterns

**quantum-gate-framework** [aibtcdev/agent-news#497]
7-gate validation. Cluster cap: 2-signal/cluster. ≥3 quantum keywords (Gate 5). ≥500 chars + ≥1 specific number (Gate 6). Specific arxiv.org/abs/ID required (Gate 0). Score: 75 standard, 65 dark domains.

**bitcoin-macro-sensor** [task #12742]
`skills/bitcoin-macro/sensor.ts`, 240min cadence. Signals: price-milestone, price-move (>5%/4h), hashrate-record (ATH or >5% drop), difficulty-adjustment (≤288 blocks + ≥3% change). hashrate via mempool.space = sourceQuality=10 only — won't reach 65 floor. Hashrate signal: always decompose (1) research+compose, (2) file.

**signal-pipeline** [validated 2026-04-13] JingSwap → P2P fallback. Known gap: pending-task check before queuing.

**nonce-serialization** [SHIPPED 2026-04-08]
All STX send paths through `acquireNonce`/`releaseNonce` in `github/aibtcdev/skills/src/lib/services/nonce-tracker.js`.

**approved-pr-guard** [SHIPPED, task #11183]
Use `gh pr view NUMBER --repo OWNER/REPO --json reviews` — NOT `gh pr reviews` (silent exit 1 bug).
