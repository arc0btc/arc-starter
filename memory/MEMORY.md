## [A] Active Items

**daily-eval** [ROLLING, last 2026-06-10 task #18526] Weighted 2.00/5 — S:1 O:2 E:1 C:5 Ad:2 Co:1 Se:3. Signal filing paused (S=1). Ops 88.2% (15/17). Cost excellent: $0.238/task, $4.05/day (C:5). E:1 — 0 PR reviews. Low-activity day, cost efficiency best metric. Overwrite this line next eval — do not accumulate.

**arc0me-site PR #8 merge blocker** [2026-06-08 01:41Z, task #18410] Blog post "2026-06-08-forty-eight-hours" committed to feat/blog-tags branch. PR #8 cannot merge to main — conflicts in astro.config.mjs, package.json, src/content.config.ts, src/content/docs/, src/styles/custom.css. Requires whoabuddy review and merge.

**x402-signal-payment** [LIVE 2026-05-04] `POST /api/signals` requires 100 sats sBTC. Treasury: `SP1KGHF33817ZXW27CG50JXWC0Y6BNXAQ4E7YGAHM`. Budget: 199,600 sats (~1,996 signals). Gap: file-signal does NOT poll 202 (pending) — still open.

**signal-filing-paused** [POLICY 2026-05-19, whoabuddy] ALL signal filing paused. EIC stepped down, trading competition winding down. Disabled via `SIGNAL_FILING_DISABLED = true` in: aibtc-news-editorial, bitcoin-macro, arxiv-research; full-skip in aibtc-news-deal-flow, aibtc-agent-trading. Re-enable: grep `SIGNAL_FILING_DISABLED` and flip to false.

**zest-audit-bounty** [SUBMITTED 2026-06-03, task #18169] Static analysis of `pool-borrow-v2-3` submitted to bounty mpwj1rjde88d5b53b990 (5k sats). Submission ID: mpxf5rek026008332af2. Closes 2026-06-16. gregoryford963-sys also submitted (suspect). **Bounty API**: `POST /api/bounties/{id}/submit` with BIP-137 via `arc skills run --name bitcoin-wallet -- btc-sign`.

**rfc-0007-0010** [PHASE 1 COMPLETE 2026-05-29] All 4 agent-runtime RFC tasks shipped. arc-starter paused (c33d41b6); agent-runtime live at `/home/dev/agent-runtime`. Next: RFC 0011 (escalation ladder) + ADAPT ports.

**Dead-ends** (no autonomous Arc action — see dead-ends.md):
- **amber-otter** — credential exposure 2026-05-18 (gregoryford963-sys). Awaiting key rotation by owner.
- **payout-disputes** — 11 disputes 30+d stale since 2026-04-26. Requires whoabuddy direct outreach.
- **wallet-rotation** — awaiting whoabuddy policy decision since 2026-04-24.
- **loom-spiral** — workflow 23 token spiral. No runs until whoabuddy resolves root cause.
- **pr-511** — aibtc-mcp-server PR #511: package rename + proprietary license + IPI blocklist. Awaiting author.

## [S] Signal Filing Rules

**STATUS: PAUSED** as of 2026-05-19 per whoabuddy policy. Re-enable: grep `SIGNAL_FILING_DISABLED` and flip to false.

**Active beats**: `aibtc-network`, `bitcoin-macro`, `quantum`. Retired beats return 410.
**Cap**: 10 approved/day/beat. **Cost**: 100 sats → 5k (approved) or 20k (brief) = 50-200× ROI.
**Format**: headline (factual), body ≤1000 chars, end with "For agents:", sources as JSON array objects.
**EIC Rubric** (DC #644): Source quality(30) + Thesis(25) + Relevance(10) + Timeliness(15) + Disclosure(10) + Utility(10). Min: 75.
**Cooldown**: 60min GLOBAL. Check cooldown at SENSOR TIME, not dispatch. `file-signal` requires `--tags` or 400 error.
**Cooldown at dispatch**: (1) close as `failed`, (2) new task with `--scheduled-for <clear+5min>`.
**Quantum**: ≥3 keywords, specific arxiv.org/abs/ID, machine-readable primary source.
**Skill names**: `arxiv-research` (quantum/bitcoin-dev), `aibtc-news-editorial` (signal filing). "quantum" and "arc-signal-manager" are INVALID.

## [P] Critical Patterns
→ Full 27 validated patterns: `memory/patterns.md`. Key operational rules (headlines only):

**Dispatch/queue**
- Completed task is TERMINAL — resurrection is always a bug. `requeueTask` guards `WHERE status != 'completed'` (db.ts). Never set completed→pending.
- Side-effecting tasks (email/STX/x402): check idempotency FIRST. Before sending, verify sent folder for matching subject. Re-dispatch + non-idempotent = duplicate sends.
- Dispatch-stale alerts: always FP — verify PID + recent cycle_log timestamps.
- Blocked external-dependency: if 3+ consecutive block-reviews confirm same external block, apply 48h+ cooldown before next review.
- Signal-filing tasks must be sonnet: haiku times out.

**PR reviews**
- Pre-flight: `gh pr view --json state` — if MERGED/CLOSED, close task as completed.
- Re-verify author fix-claims: fetch ACTUAL file at head SHA (`gh api repos/O/R/contents/PATH?ref=<sha> --jq .content | base64 -d`), NOT cached diff.
- bff-skills PRs: pre-flight mandatory (gregoryford963-sys generates stale-PR noise). Sensor-level dedup needed.
- Bounty-farming flood (3+ identical rejections): escalate to whoabuddy, don't loop.

**Sensors**
- Signal cooldown: check at SENSOR time. Staleness: fetch live timestamps, not cached values.
- Zero-fix churn: sensor producing 0-fix tasks consistently → add 4h recency guard.
- CVE same repo: group identical CVEs, assess once, apply ruling uniformly.
- `recent.log` consolidation: threshold 500 lines; long-term fix = age-based archiving (>14d).

**Cloudflare**
- DO row reads dominate free tier (5M/day), NOT invocations. Diagnose via `durableObjectsStorageGroups.rowsRead`. CF DO SQLite and D1 share the same 5M/day tier — migration alone doesn't fix quota burns.
- 1min-cadence sensors against SQLite-backed DOs must use cursors or they'll saturate row-read tier.

**Misc**
- X API HTTP 402 = CreditsDepleted (NOT rate limit). Park as `blocked`, escalate to whoabuddy for credit top-up. Won't auto-recover.
- arc0.me freshness: ~4-7 day cadence while filing paused. Proactive blog scheduling every 3-5d prevents reactive patches.
- AIBTC deck titles MUST lead with "AIBTC". Stats: never from memory, always re-query.
- build-without-deploy: build success ≠ deploy success. Verify deploy step ran. After deploying blog post, verify it appears in repo, not just that deploy command ran.
- `tasks update --status blocked` NOT supported — only `tasks close --status blocked`.
- x402 404 = agent deregistered — do NOT retry. Per-file reads in dispatch = token explosion (>10 files → add CLI first).

## [L] Core Validated Patterns

**quantum-gate-framework** [aibtcdev/agent-news#497]
7-gate validation. Cluster cap: 2-signal/cluster. ≥3 quantum keywords (Gate 5). ≥500 chars + ≥1 specific number (Gate 6). Specific arxiv.org/abs/ID required (Gate 0). Score: 75 standard, 65 dark domains.

**bitcoin-macro-sensor** [task #12742]
`skills/bitcoin-macro/sensor.ts`, 240min cadence. Signals: price-milestone, price-move (>5%/4h), hashrate-record (ATH or >5% drop), difficulty-adjustment (≤288 blocks + ≥3% change). hashrate via mempool.space = sourceQuality=10 only — won't reach 65 floor. Hashrate signal: always decompose (1) research+compose, (2) file.

**signal-pipeline** [validated 2026-04-13] JingSwap → P2P fallback. Known gap: pending-task check before queuing.

**nonce-serialization** [SHIPPED 2026-04-08]
All STX send paths through `acquireNonce`/`releaseNonce` in `github/aibtcdev/skills/src/lib/services/nonce-tracker.js`.

**approved-pr-guard** [SHIPPED, task #11183]
Use `gh pr view NUMBER --repo OWNER/REPO --json reviews` — NOT `gh pr reviews` (silent exit 1 bug).
